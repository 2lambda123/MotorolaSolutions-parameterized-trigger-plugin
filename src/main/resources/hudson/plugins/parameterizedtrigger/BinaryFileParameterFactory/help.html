  Look for files that match the specified pattern in the current build, then
  for each of them trigger a build of the specified project(s) by passing
  that file as a file parameter.

  <p>
  This implementation does not interpret the contents of those files, and instead
  it simply gets passed and placed into the workspace of the triggered project(s)
  under the name specified here.

  <p>
  This is useful, for example, when you have a portion of the job that can be split
  into concurrently executable subtasks. In such a situation, you can have an earlier
  step produce subtask work units by packaging necessary stuff into individual files,
  then use this mode to execute them all in parallel.
